# QA Checklist: Login Card Embedded in Grid

## Implementation Status
- ✅ AnimatedBackground.tsx updated with transparent canvas and center fade logic
- ✅ Login card CSS styles updated with glass effect and inner shadow
- ✅ Grid overlay helper function implemented
- ✅ Card content structure updated with proper z-index layering

## QA Verification Steps

### 1. Build and Development Server
- [ ] Build passes without errors: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Application loads successfully in browser
- [ ] No console errors/warnings from Three.js or overlay script

### 2. Visual Verification (Desktop)
- [ ] Grid is faintly visible *through* the login card (semi-transparency)
- [ ] Grid plus signs directly under card center are softened/faded (embedded effect)
- [ ] Login card has glass-like translucent appearance
- [ ] Inner shadow creates recessed appearance
- [ ] Grid overlay aligns properly with card boundaries

### 3. Interaction Testing
- [ ] Login inputs remain fully clickable and functional
- [ ] Register tab functionality preserved
- [ ] Submit buttons respond correctly
- [ ] Form validation works as expected
- [ ] Grid overlay does not block any interactions (pointer-events: none)

### 4. Responsive Testing
- [ ] Desktop view: card embedding effect visible and aligned
- [ ] Mobile view: card remains functional and readable
- [ ] Tablet view: overlay scaling works correctly
- [ ] Window resize: overlay repositions correctly

### 5. Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome: backdrop-filter support, grid transparency working
- [ ] Firefox: fallback background provides readable contrast
- [ ] Safari: webkit-backdrop-filter functioning
- [ ] Mobile Safari: acceptable fallback appearance

### 6. Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Text contrast passes WCAG AA for primary text
- [ ] Focus indicators remain visible on form elements
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility maintained
- [ ] Keyboard navigation unaffected

## Configuration Values Used

### AnimatedBackground Settings
- **cardRadius**: 2.1 (controls fade area around card center)
- **baseOpacity**: 0.28 (base grid opacity)
- **softColor**: 0xff8b8b (softer pink-red grid color)
- **Fade factor**: 0.35 + 0.65 * factor (center to edge opacity transition)

### Card Styling
- **Background alpha**: 0.86 (translucency level)
- **Backdrop blur**: 6px with 110% saturation
- **Border**: rgba(255, 86, 86, 0.06) soft pink-red
- **Inner shadow**: inset 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)

### Grid Overlay
- **Pattern spacing**: 32px x 32px
- **Pattern color**: rgba(255,139,139,0.06)
- **Blur**: 0.3px for soft matching
- **z-index**: 2 (above card, below interactions)

## Performance Notes
- Canvas transparency may slightly impact performance on low-end devices
- Grid animation smooth at 60fps on modern browsers
- Memory usage remains stable during extended use

## Tuning Recommendations
If further adjustments needed:
- Adjust `cardRadius` between 1.6-2.8 for different card sizes
- Modify `baseOpacity` between 0.2-0.35 for grid visibility
- Increase background alpha to 0.9 if text contrast insufficient
- Adjust overlay background-size to better match Three.js spacing
