# EmergencyConnect - Production Deployment Requirements

## Overview
EmergencyConnect is a production-ready emergency response coordination platform built with React, TypeScript, and Express. This document outlines the deployment requirements for hosting the backend on Railway.com and frontend on Vercel.com.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (deployed on Vercel)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (deployed on Railway)
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless, user-managed)
- **Real-time**: Native WebSocket implementation
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing

## Deployment Configuration

### Backend (Railway.com)
The backend is configured for Railway deployment with:
- `railway.json` configuration file
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- Environment variables for production
- PostgreSQL database integration
- WebSocket server support

### Frontend (Vercel.com)
The frontend is configured for Vercel deployment with:
- `vercel.json` configuration file
- Vite build optimization
- Environment variable support for API URL
- SPA routing configuration

## Required Environment Variables

### Backend (Railway)
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgresql_url
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_minimum_32_chars
NODE_ENV=production
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key (optional)
```

### Frontend (Vercel)
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend-url.railway.app
```

## Security Features
- ✅ Secure JWT authentication with 32+ character secret
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Production error handling (no stack traces exposed)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Environment-specific configurations

## Production Optimizations
- ✅ Auto-dismissing success toasts (5 seconds)
- ✅ Error boundary implementation
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- ✅ Health check endpoints for monitoring
- ✅ Cross-origin API request handling
- ✅ WebSocket connection resilience

## Build Commands

### For Railway (Backend)
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### For Vercel (Frontend)
```bash
npm install
npm run build:client
```

## Database Requirements
- Neon PostgreSQL database with existing schema
- Connection string configured in Railway environment
- Database migrations handled via Drizzle ORM

## Monitoring & Health Checks
- Health check endpoint: `GET /api/health`
- Returns database connectivity status
- Service uptime and version information
- Environment and timestamp data

## User Roles & Features
1. **Patient Dashboard**: Emergency requests, hospital selection, real-time tracking
2. **Ambulance Operator**: Request acceptance, GPS tracking, navigation
3. **Hospital Staff**: Bed management, incoming ambulance tracking, resource allocation
4. **Admin Dashboard**: System oversight, user management, analytics

## External Dependencies
- Google Maps API (for location services and navigation)
- Neon PostgreSQL (database hosting)
- Railway.com (backend hosting)
- Vercel.com (frontend hosting)

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Deploy backend to Railway.com with environment variables
2. Deploy frontend to Vercel.com with API URL configuration
3. Configure Google Maps API key when ready for production
4. Test cross-origin WebSocket and API connections
5. Monitor health check endpoints for system status

This application is now production-ready with comprehensive security, error handling, and deployment configurations.
