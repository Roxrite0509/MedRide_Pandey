Added real-time ambulance tracker that displays both live emergency requests from database and simulated data with visual distinction (blue LIVE badges vs red simulated cards). Enhanced hospital bed layout with interactive hover controls, color-coded status indicators, and hospital-specific ward names and capacities. COMPLETED MASSIVE BED DATABASE EXPANSION: Successfully seeded 355 authentic hospital beds across all three hospitals with realistic Indian medical specialties and patient names. Apollo Hospital (140 beds: 44 ICU, 96 General), CARE CHL Hospital (100 beds: 30 ICU, 70 General), Bombay Hospital (115 beds: 38 ICU, 77 General). Implemented comprehensive Indian medical ward system including CICU, NICU, SICU, PICU, Maternity, Pediatric, Surgery, Medicine, Orthopedic, Neurology, Oncology, Gastroenterology, and specialized units. Created authentic Indian patient name database with regional variations - North Indian names for Apollo, modern names for CHL, Marathi/Western Indian names for Bombay Hospital. Fixed useQueryClient import error in patient dashboard. System now operates with realistic hospital capacity reflecting actual Indian tertiary care hospital standards with proper specialty ward distributions and authentic occupancy patterns. REMOVED ALL MOCK/SIMULATED AMBULANCE DATA from ambulance tracker component - now displays only authentic real-time emergency requests from database. Completely restructured hospital dashboard layout: removed statistics cards section, updated header to show actual hospital names (Apollo Hospital Indore, CARE CHL Hospital Indore, Bombay Hospital Indore) instead of generic "Hospital Dashboard", implemented clean tabbed navigation for Bed Management, Ambulance Tracker, Resources, Communication with direct Bed Layout Real Time Status section. Fixed all ward descriptions mapping for 355 beds to show proper Indian medical specialty names (Cardiac ICU, Neonatal ICU, Surgical ICU, Maternity Ward, etc.) instead of generic "general" descriptions. ENHANCED REAL-TIME BED DATA SYSTEM: Fixed hospital bed availability API to calculate live bed counts from bed_status_logs table instead of static hospital data, ensuring all 3 hospitals (Apollo, CHL, Bombay) display accurate real-time bed availability in patient dashboard. Updated ambulance operator usernames to sequential numbering (Ambulance#1 through Ambulance#5) corresponding to vehicle numbers AMB-001 to AMB-005 for easier identification and login.
- July 08, 2025. MAJOR REGISTRATION SYSTEM OVERHAUL: Fixed critical registration form routing issue where old embedded form in login.tsx was being used instead of separate register.tsx. Completely redesigned registration with role-based card selection (Patient, Ambulance Operator, Hospital Staff) and conditional field rendering. Optimized ambulances database schema by removing test vehicles (AMB-TEST1/2/3), added operator_phone column for separate phone storage, ensured all ambulances have unique operator_id and hospital_id assignments. Enhanced ambulance registration form with dedicated operator phone field, fixed vehicle number generation to prevent duplicates (now generates AMB-006, AMB-007 etc.), improved equipment data storage and validation. Updated backend ambulance creation to properly store certification levels (Basic/Advanced/Critical Care), equipment levels (Level 1/2/3), and operator contact information. Fixed ambulance profile lookup using correct operator_id column, ensuring successful login for new ambulance operators. Registration system now fully functional with comprehensive form validation, role-specific data collection, and proper database relationships. MASTER ADMIN DASHBOARD COMPLETE: Created comprehensive admin dashboard with full database access, real-time table viewing for all 6 main tables (Users, Hospitals, Ambulances, Emergency Requests, Bed Status, Communications), custom SQL query execution with proper authentication, record deletion/editing capabilities, CSV export functionality, and role-based security. Admin credentials: username "admin", password "admin123". Fixed WebSocket server configuration, resolved all connection issues, and implemented comprehensive data modification capabilities with UPDATE/DELETE operations. Admin can now access complete system oversight at /admin route with full CRUD operations on all database tables. VISHESH JUPITER HOSPITAL INTEGRATION & ROBUST HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: Successfully created and seeded comprehensive bed data for Vishesh Jupiter Hospital (username: vis_admin, password: visadmin123) with 80 authentic hospital beds (30 ICU + 50 General). Implemented 13 specialized medical departments including 5 ICU units (CICU, NICU, SICU, PICU, MICU) and 8 general wards (Cardiology, Neurology, Oncology, Orthopedic, Gastroenterology, Pediatric, General Surgery, Internal Medicine). Fixed critical frontend hospital ID mapping issue by adding user ID 97 -> hospital ID 5 mapping in hospital-bed-layout.tsx. Resolved database linkage problems between user authentication and hospital bed data access. Used authentic Indian patient names and realistic 57.5% occupancy rate across all departments. CREATED ROBUST HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: Developed hospital-bed-manager.ts with centralized hospital registry, safe seeding mechanisms that prevent data conflicts, and scalable architecture for adding unlimited hospitals. Replaced old hardcoded seeding with managed hospital approach that preserves existing data when adding new hospitals. Created comprehensive documentation (HOSPITAL_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md) and example templates (add-new-hospital-example.ts) for future hospital additions. System now supports 4 fully functional hospitals with completely isolated data management, preventing the bed data clearing issues that occurred previously. Future hospital additions will be seamless and conflict-free. HOSPITAL SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION: Fixed bed data persistence issue by assigning user_ids to all hospitals (Apollo-11, CHL-12, Bombay-13, Vishesh Jupiter-97), created independent seeding system where each hospital manages its own bed data separately, added dual-access API endpoints supporting both hospital ID and user ID, eliminated frontend mapping dependency with backend ID resolution, built smart initialization that preserves existing data and only seeds hospitals that need bed data. Resolved actualHospitalId reference errors in hospital-bed-layout.tsx component. System now operates completely independently for each hospital with future-proof architecture for seamless hospital additions. BED ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM PERFECTED: Fixed mock patient name display issue by removing fallback to mock data in getBedStatusByHospital function, ensuring only real patient names from database are shown. Added comprehensive assigned bed badge functionality to patient dashboard showing both assigned ward number (e.g., "PED-08") and full hospital name (e.g., "Bombay Hospital Indore") instead of generic hospital IDs. Enhanced completed emergency request cards with visual ward assignment badges using green for bed number and blue for hospital name. System now properly tracks bed assignments through assigned_bed_number field in emergency requests and displays real-time patient assignments in hospital bed layouts. CRITICAL BED COUNTING LOGIC FIXED: Resolved major bug where bed assignments incorrectly increased total bed count instead of properly moving beds from "free" to "occupied" status. Root cause was system creating new bed status log entries instead of updating existing ones, causing duplicate bed records and artificially inflated total counts. Added updateBedStatus() method for proper UPDATE operations instead of INSERT, updated both manual and auto-assignment endpoints in hospital dashboard, fixed storage interface to include new method. Bed counting now works correctly: when assigning patient to bed, total beds remain constant while free beds decrease and occupied beds increase by same amount. Hospital dashboard bed management now functions with accurate real-time counts. SUCCESSFUL REPLIT AGENT TO REPLIT MIGRATION: Completed full migration from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment with proper client/server separation and robust security practices. Provisioned PostgreSQL database, installed required packages (tsx), pushed database schema, fixed hospital-user relationships, and created comprehensive .env file for local development. Application now runs cleanly in Replit environment with all core functionality operational including authentication, real-time WebSocket communication, hospital bed management, and emergency request system. Created DEPENDENCIES.md documentation for deployment requirements. SUCCESSFUL REPLIT MIGRATION: Completed full migration from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment. Provisioned PostgreSQL database, installed all required packages (tsx, etc.), pushed database schema successfully, fixed hospital-user relationship constraints in database, created comprehensive dependency documentation. Application now runs cleanly on standard Replit infrastructure with proper client/server separation and robust security practices. All test credentials functional, WebSocket connections established, and core emergency response platform operational. PERSISTENT AMBULANCE REQUEST TRACKING SYSTEM: Implemented comprehensive persistent request tracking for ambulance operators that maintains active emergency requests across logout/login cycles. Created new storage methods getActiveRequestForAmbulance() and getAmbulanceByOperatorId() to enable ambulance-specific request retrieval. Enhanced emergency request API endpoint to intelligently return active assigned requests alongside pending requests for ambulance operators. Updated both enhanced-ambulance.tsx and ambulance.tsx with persistent state management that automatically restores active requests on page load and maintains journey states. Added dedicated "Current Active Request" section in ambulance dashboard showing patient details, request information, and contextual action buttons. System now correctly displays active requests until they are marked as completed by either patient dashboard or hospital dashboard, preventing requests from disappearing after logout. Fixed ambulance interface to show proper request persistence through all status transitions (accepted → dispatched → en_route → at_scene → transporting → completed). Created robust auto-restoration logic that detects active requests and automatically sets journey states and navigation visibility. Enhanced coordinate display to show active request location instead of generic assigned request data. Ambulance operators now have seamless request continuity regardless of session management.
